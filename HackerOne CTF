## Micro-CMS v1

1. Frobidden page

Url is formed by adding a page number at the end like page/1
By checking range between 1st page and the page-id I got by creating a new one, I found that one of the pages is forbidden
But the page could still be downloaded, if we try the other path - url for editing page,which is /page/edit/forbiddenId

2. Stored XSS

Change the title of a page to add some script, like </a> <script>alert(1)</script><a>
The title is sanitized at the "page" page, but if I go back to home srcreen, the script works
